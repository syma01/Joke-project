<p>  A woman gets on a bus with her baby. <br>The driver says : 
     Ugh,that’s the ugliest<br> baby I’ve ever seen!
     The woman walks<br>
	 to the back of the bus and sits down.<br>
     She says to the man next to her: 
	 The <br>driver just insulted me!
	 The man says: <br>
     You go up there and tell him off.
	 Go on. I’ll hold your monkey for you.</p>
