<h4>Your joke of the day.</h4>
<p>A man walks into a shop and sees a cute little dog.<br>
     He asks the shopkeeper:<br>
     -Does your dog bite?<br>
     -No, my dog does not bite.<br>
     The man tries to pet the dog and the dog bites him.<br>
     -Ouch, you said your dog does not bite!<br>
     -Yeah, I said, but that is not my dog.</p>
